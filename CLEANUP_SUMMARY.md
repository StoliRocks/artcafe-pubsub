## How to Clean Up

If you haven't run the cleanup yet:
```bash
cd /home/stvwhite/projects/artcafe/artcafe-pubsub
./cleanup_outdated_files.sh
```

This will:
1. Create a backup directory with timestamp
2. Move all outdated files to the backup
3. Preserve all important files
4. Allow you to review and delete the backup later

## Architecture Documentation

The implementation is now fully documented in:
- `/architecture/HLD-Authentication-Architecture.md` - Complete auth architecture with implementation details
- `/artcafe-pubsub/README.md` - Service overview and deployment guide
- `/artcafe-pubsub/CLAUDE.md` - Developer notes for Claude Code

## Current State

The pubsub service is now:
- ✅ Using optimal architecture (Nginx → FastAPI)
- ✅ No JWT tokens for agents
- ✅ CORS handled by Nginx only
- ✅ Clean codebase without outdated scripts
- ✅ Fully documented
- ✅ Production ready
